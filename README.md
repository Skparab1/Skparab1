### About me
  - I am a 9th grader
  - I like coding in Python
  - I also know Java and Pascal
  - I don't like Java (I find it too complicated)
  - I am currently working on Encryption code
  - I am a member of cs club

### Things I've done
  - In May 2020, I launched the world's first free text encryption service in Python, Encryption code
    - Since then, it has gone through 14 versions, with the most recent one, Encryption code 2.1, being released on April 4th, 2021
    - In December 2020, I launched the Encryption code website, which can now be viewed at sites.google.com/view/encryptioncode
    - In late March 2021, Encryption code Pro was announced, and it is set to be released in mid summer 2020.
    - In early May 2021, an Encryption code Video will be released.
  - Created game codes that can be played in a single user interface
    - Check out my game-codes and dino-game repositories
### Things I'm working on right now
  - Encryption code
    - Encryption code video: I'm working on a video for Encryption and animations for it. The video will be released in Early may 2021.
    - Encryption code app: An app that will have the full functionallity of Encryption code. Possibly can integrate within other apps. Release date not yet announced.
    - Encryption code Pro: The next generation, paid version of Encryption code. Release date estimated to be mid summer 2021.
    - Encryption code 2.2: The next version of Encryption code.
 - An AI engine
    - I'm working on an AI engine, similar to a virtual assistant, except with integrated machine learning
    - Name still not finalized
 - Master math calculator
    - Compilation of all math codes in my math codes repo. Runs on command line interface.
    - Check out my master-math-calculator repository
 - Dino game
    - Replicating google chrome no internet game in Python.
