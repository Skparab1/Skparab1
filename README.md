### About me
  - I am a 9th grader
  - I like coding in Python
  - I also know Java and Pascal
  - I don't like Java (I find it too complicated) and Pascal is kinda old so I use Python most of the time
  - I am currently working on Encryption code
  - I am a member of cs club

### Things I've done
  - In May 2020, I launched the world's first free text encryption service in Python, Encryption code
    - Since then, it has gone through 14 versions, with the most recent one, Encryption code 2.1, being released on April 4th, 2021
    - In December 2020, I launched the Encryption code website, which can now be viewed at sites.google.com/view/encryptioncode
    - In late March 2021, Encryption code Pro was announced, and it is set to be released in mid summer 2020.
    - On May 7th 2021, I released the Encryption code video. You can view it at youtu.be/7Jy2Ln0EdFQ.
  - Created game codes that can be played in a single user interface
    - Check out my game-codes, dino-game, and crossy-road repositories
### Things I'm working on right now
  - Encryption code
    - Encryption code app: An app that will have the full functionality of Encryption code. Possibly can integrate within other apps. Release date not yet announced.
